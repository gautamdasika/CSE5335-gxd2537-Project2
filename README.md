Project 1

a. I chose Express on top of NodeJS, because I'm not very familiar with Web Technologies and used Javascript before. So, it was easy for me to adapt to NodeJS, since it uses the same syntax.

b. I chose AngularJS, since it seemed to be the one with the most users and the way to use it was very intuitive. Since it had many users, I could get answers for any doubt that I had.

c. I found the graph making to be quite easy, since I already did it before. Also because there's no new technology to be learnt.

d. Accessing JSON data in different parts of the file was a bit tricky, since it had to be called from scope objects in HTML and variables in Javascript.

e. I didn't install any extra components other than Express JS. I installed Express so that I can get basic things by default and can concentrate on the project requirements.

f. node index.js
