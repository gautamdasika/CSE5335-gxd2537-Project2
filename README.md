Project 1

a. I chose Express on top of NodeJS, because I'm familiar with Javascript. So, it was easy for me to adapt to NodeJS, since it uses the same syntax.

b. I chose AngularJS, since it seemed to be the one with the most users and the way to use it was very intuitive. Since it had many users, I could get answers for any doubt that I had.

c. I found the graph making to be quite easy, since I already did it before. Also because there's no new technology to be learnt.

d. Accessing JSON data in different parts of the file was a bit tricky, since it had to be called from scope objects in HTML and variables in Javascript.

e. I didn't install any extra components other than Express JS. I installed Express so that I can get basic things by default and can concentrate on the project requirements.

f. node index.js
